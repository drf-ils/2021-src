#### **Topic: Questions of Value: Libraries, Learning Analytics, and Student Privacy**


**Speaker Bio:** Dr. Andrew Asher is the Assessment Librarian at Indiana University Bloomington, where he leads the libraries’ qualitative and quantitative assessment programs, conducts research on the anthropology of information, and teaches research methods in information science.  Asher’s most recent work examines search and discovery workflows of students and faculty, information fluency development, and the ethical and privacy dimensions of learning analytics data.  He is currently a member of the Data Doubles research team, a three-year IMLS funded study of student perspectives of privacy issues associated with learning analytics initiatives in libraries.    Asher holds a PhD in sociocultural anthropology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and has written and presented widely on applying ethnography and mixed-methods research in academic libraries, including the co-edited volume, College Libraries and Student Culture.
