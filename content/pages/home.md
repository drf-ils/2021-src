<font size="5">Welcome to the Department of Information & Library Science Doctoral Research Forum 2021 (ILS-DRF 2021)!</font>

<br>

ILS-DRF 2021 will be held on Nov. 12, 2021. The forum provides a great opportunity for doctoral students to present their ongoing research and discuss their ideas with peers and faculty members. To maximally reach out to the audience and keep us healthy, we finally decided to hold the event fully online through Zoom.

<!-- The forum is expected to be held in-person to realize social activities and personal contacts, which are so
important in our professional and scientific lives. All participants are expected to follow
the [IU Community's COVID-19 Guidelines](https://www.iu.edu/covid/index.html) at the conference.
Given the current situation and new virus variants, however, the conference's modality may be switched to online
to be aligned with the policy of IU. -->

The Doctoral Research Forum is a yearly event of the ILS. It focuses on motivating Ph.D. students to participate in innovative research through the lens of information science, library science, social sciences, policy studies, and other disciplines. As evaluated by the previous doctoral program director Dr. Xiaozhong Liu, "our doctoral program is the heart of the ILS research community."

<!-- All submission will be reviewed **by the ILS faculty**(or a faculty-student combined committee? **TBD**).  -->
Presentation time will vary depending on the number of presentations. At the time of writing, we expect a maximum of 15 minutes to present, followed by 5 minutes QA.

<!-- As in previous years, the program of the conference may include a poster session in addition to the main conference.
The poster session hinges on how many participates are willing to attend. So please state if you would like to
present a poster when submitting your abstract. -->
